# XpressShutdown
Shutdown your machine from your very own network; remotely

# Background
* You're like me and you don't have TV on your bedroom but you have a PC connected to your LAN.
* You're just watching YouTube videos or whatever (from your bed) and it's almost sleeping time.
* You don't want to get out of bed to shutdown the PC because you're warm there and your bedroom is colder than the heart of your ex.

# Requirements
* Be laying in your bed
* Use a `Windows` machine otherwise the hardcoded command won't work
* Have `nodejs` installed in your machine.

# Welp; Worry NOT, I'm here to save the day (at least mine)

Just run this app and get the server running in your local network.
